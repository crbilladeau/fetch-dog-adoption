## Note from the dev

I added a few unit tests, which use Jest and React Testing Library. While I did not have time to implement 100% coverage, the idea of adding unit tests was to demonstrate my testing philosophy and general approach to testing. You can check out the following examples here:

- [DogCard.test.tsx](https://github.com/crbilladeau/fetch-dog-adoption/blob/master/src/authenticated-routes/SearchDashboard/DogsList/components/__tests__/DogCard.test.tsx)
- [FavoritesContext.test.tsx](https://github.com/crbilladeau/fetch-dog-adoption/blob/master/src/context/__tests__/FavoritesContext.test.tsx)
- [useFetchBreeds.test.ts](https://github.com/crbilladeau/fetch-dog-adoption/blob/master/src/hooks/fetchers/__tests__/useFetchBreeds.test.ts)
- [Login.test.tsx](https://github.com/crbilladeau/fetch-dog-adoption/blob/master/src/unauthenticated-routes/Login/__tests__/Login.test.tsx)
- [LoginForm.test.tsx](https://github.com/crbilladeau/fetch-dog-adoption/blob/master/src/unauthenticated-routes/Login/__tests__/LoginForm.test.tsx)
